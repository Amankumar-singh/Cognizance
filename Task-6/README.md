#           Web Music Payer For Entertainment
### Entertainment can distract you from the stress-causing factors in your life. Your body releases endorphins when you participate in entertaining or fun activities. 
* Music stimulates the brain which in turn helps with pain relief, reducing stress and memory. A study from Harvard has shown that relaxing music may lower blood pressure and heart rate after physical exertion.

* The joy  can get from music will help lift our spirits and those of everybody else involved.
Whether it’s learning our favourite tune, performing on stage or a good old sing-a-long with our mates, music brings fun!

* Music provides an opportunity for people from all social and cultural backgrounds to express themselves.
Whether it’s to convey a political message, a particular emotion or just for the sheer joy, musicians have used sound and music since the dawn of primitive man as a way of expressing themselves and getting their voices heard.



* Music creates social cohesion, it speaks to all when words can fail, and wherever you go in the world, it is understood. Music is a universal gift and its power to connect people is without question. It is an art form with human interaction at its centre.
